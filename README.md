This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).


## Description
A humorous web app where a Guru answers questions and decides things for the user.
Technologies Used: React.js, JSX, CSS, Bootstrap, 10 different APIs.


[Live DEMO](https://daph3105.github.io/Project2/#/)

The site is divided in 4 different sections:

1. Yes/ No Questions: The Guru answers YES or NO questions with the help of a gif, you can click on one of the popular questions or type your own.
2. This or That questions: If you are undecided between 2 things, you can ask the Guru to pick one for you, for example if you don't know whether to eat Italian food or Mexican food, you can type it out and click Pick Now to ask the Guru to pick one for you. 
3. Let the Guru decide things for you: The Guru can tell you what to do, what to watch ( with description or youtube trailer), what to listen (with a link to the song), what to eat ( with a link to the recipe), and if you should stay home of go out, and a suggestion on what to do if you stay or leave.
4. Advice from the Guru: you can click to ask the Guru for as many advices as you want.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
